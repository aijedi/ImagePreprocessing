# Image Pre-Processing

The given Jupyter Notebook lists the functions and methods for pre-processing give image data.

## The following pre-processing steps are considered here :

### 1. Resize an image without distortion OpenCV
### 2. Scaling the image
### 3. Calculating the mean and the standard Deviations of the Input Data
 3.1 Standard Deviation
 3.2 Mean
### 4. Normalizing Images
 - Ensures that each input parameter has similar data distribution .
 - Subtract mean from each pixel and divide by the standard deviation .
### 5. Data Augmentation
 - Augmenting existing data with peturbed versions of existing images .
 - Scaling , rotations and other affine transformations .	

 5.1 Rotation
 5.2 Affine Transformation
 5.3 Perspective Transformation


# Running the Code
Its a Jupyter Notebook file 

> Make sure the required python libraries of OpenCV and Numpy are installed .
